      <h1>Pat's Salmon Cookie's</h1>
      <p>Pat has come up with a business idea by combining his love for sweets and his passion for healthy ecosystems. Pat
        has developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. These cookies made into the shape of a
        salmon and are suitable for both humans and animals to enjoy.</p>

      <p>We have many different shapes, sizes, and designes of our Salmon Cookies. We even have doggy cookies that taste LIKE salmon! If you buy our Family Pack, you get a box of 20 Salmon Cookies, a bag of our doggy cookies, as well as our Salmon shirt and cookie cutter! Now only $50! If that's too much for you, try one of our basic Salmon Cookies, only $5 a pack(comes with 3). And right now you can win our Salmon T-shirt and cookie cutter by entering into our drawing!
